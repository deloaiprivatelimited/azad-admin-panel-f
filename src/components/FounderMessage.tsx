              To solve these difficulties, to break myths of the civils services examination and to provide quality coaching and best coaching, I established 'SRINIVAS IAS ACADEMY' in the name of Shaheed 'Chandreshekhar Azad', a revolutionary who sacrificed his life for India. Our aim is to make people of India and Karnataka synonymous to IAS/KAS and other civil Services.
